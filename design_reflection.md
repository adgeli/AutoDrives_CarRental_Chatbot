## Background

### The Problem 

The world of driving is changing significantly. Manually operating vehicles is a concept of the past as we move into an era of autonomous, self-driving cars. Thus, just because the method of driving is changing, doesn’t mean people will have less destinations, or places to be. In fact, it might even increase. It is then worth questioning, if people aren’t driving their cars themselves anymore, would they need to own a car? Could there be an autonomous car rental system to cater to this?

    How might we build a chatbot to help people book an autonomous vehicle?

### Research 

There is extensive research by numerous scholars who have studied the trends, impacts and evident future of autonomous vehicles. One study conducted by Fagnant and Kockelman mentions how having an increasing number of autonomous vehicles on the road will not only improve traffic but is predicted to cause less car-accidents (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2014). In addition, with an increased use of autonomous vehicles comes a decrease in emissions released from gas-powered vehicles into our atmosphere, helping tackle global warming (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2014).  It is the positive social and environmental impacts that will be a driving force in consumers adopting autonomous cars into their daily lives (Sparrow & Howard, 2017). Ensuring that the autonomous cars are built with the passenger’s safety as priority will also be a determining factor in the adoption rate (2017). Thus, helping to foresee how far (or close) into the future we are to having a society driven by autonomous vehicles (2017). There was a study conducted by Bansal and Kockelman in 2017 forecasting the long-term adoption rate of autonomous vehicles by Americans. It was found that up to 87% of Americans in the study would be willing to adopt and purchase an autonomous vehicle by 2045, a significant determinant was increasing prices in purchasing (Bansal & Kockelman, 2017). Thus, with all this in mind, it is recognizable that autonomous cars is a future trend we all must prepare to adapt to in some shape or form.

**Ideation:**

Chatbots are an ever-increasing technology implemented by many web administrators to. perform tasks and generate conversations with users (Reshmi & Balakrishnan, 2018). By implementing them into a business, companies are able to save on customer service centres, while improving both efficiency of operations (able to work with more than one client at a time) and improving customer support (2018). In order for chatbots to work efficiently and gain sufficient user response is to ensure there is the element of trust established between the virtual assistant and the user (Zhou, Mark, Li & Yang, 2019). This can be formed by the chatbot bringing personal human-like elements into the conversation such as a name and friendly introducing statement (Zhou, Mark, Li & Yand, 2019). If done correctly, chatbots can power the future of business and help increase productivity in many industries (Reshmi & Balakrishnan, 2018). 
Thus, following the research above, created a chatbot that would help users book an autonomous vehicle is practically a seamless fit. 

### Project Direction 

![brainstorm](images/brainstorm.png)

**We agreed that we wanted a chatbot that would:**
- Accomplish the entire booking process for users seeking to book an autonomous vehicle.
- Design a flow of questions that was conversational and simple to follow.
- Create an excellent, personalized customer experience leaving no questions unanswered.
